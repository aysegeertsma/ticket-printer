# Ticket Printer

Hi. This is a very small and messy project to get issues from jira printed onto a Nemonic ticket printer. Do not expect
anything from it.

The tool has only been tested in Chrome under OSX.

## Basic setup and usage

Copy `.env.exampe` to `.env` and fill in the fields `JIRA_HOST`, `JIRA_USER` and `JIRA_PASS`.

Start the server: `docker-compose up -d`

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

Now select a jira board, select a sprint and start printing!
